Launching a site on AWS was a big mistake. AWS is too complicated. It is just not
for me. I finally had enough of the bullshit and moved my site to
[Now.sh](https://now.sh).

I had heard great things about Now from a podcast and had to try it out. With a
little help from a friend I was able to deploy to now.sh and have my site running
in 30 minutes.

The best part about it is that Now integrates with Github making things easy.
Every time I update my blog I can initiate a new deployment by simply commiting
my code and pushing it up to Github. This will automatically deploy my updates.

I am looking forward to publishing a ton of blog posts this year.
