I got the Playstation VR for Christmas this year. I knew I was going to love it. It was a truly incredible experience
just playing with the Playroom. In the Playroom I was converted into some giant monsters and was able to terrorize small
robots. It was very exciting. I love being able to play 2D games on it using the same television my wife is using.
